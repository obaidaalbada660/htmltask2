            <h1>About US</h1>
            <p>In our restaurant, we provide food and drinks to customers. Restaurants were initially operated on the sides of travel roads so that travelers could stop to rest and regain their vitality. Today, restaurants are almost everywhere, on quiet streets and busy roads, in hotels, airports, bus and train stations, as well as in parks, office buildings and shopping centres. Restaurants make up the largest segment of the food service industry. Stores that provide food to people outside their homes are part of this industry, including schools, hospitals, factories and prisons.</p>
